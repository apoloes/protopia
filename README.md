# Protopia Internal Dashboards

This project is for COMP 523 Software Engineering Lab. We are working with a start-up called Protopia, an online platform that fosters student-alumni engagement. We have created Vue.js dashboards to provide insights using Protopia's API. 

## Getting Started

### Running on local machine
Both the main directory and the /client directory have package.json files. For both directories, run:
```
npm install 
```
To run concurrently on your local machine, in the main directory, run:
```
npm run dev
```
The Vue project runs on localhost:8080 and the Node.js Express API runs on localhost:8000.

### Build and Deploy
